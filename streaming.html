			<h2>Notes on legality</h2>
			<p>Streaming is legally kind of a gray area, but you're fine. According to the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Lawful_Streaming_Act">
					Protecting Lawful Streaming Act of 2020</a>:</p>
				<p class="block-quote">the bill is
					tailored to specifically target the websites themselves, and not those who may use the
					sites nor those individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized
					copies of copyrighted works.</p>
				<p>
					You're only going to (potentially) get in trouble if
				  you are downloading or hosting the pirated media.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Setting yourself up</h2>
			<p>Getting malware from websites is <span class="italics">so</span> passé, and a little sad at this point.
				Please use an ad blocker. If you're using Chrome or Firefox, try <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>. If you're using Safari,
		    don't. Make sure the extension is enabled (including in an incognito window) before continuing.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Some links</h2>
			<p>If one of these URLs doesn't work, it's likely that the domain ending has changed.
				Try googling the general site name (e.g., "soap2day") for an updated link.
				If you exhaust these options, check the <a href="https://rentry.co/megathread">
					Reddit piracy megathread</a> for some more (also, let me know so I can update the list).</p>

			<h2>I still can't find it!</h2>
			<p>Try googling something like "watch scooby doo season 3 online free", and check
			the first few pages of results. Addionally, if you spot this <a target="_blank" href="https://i.ibb.co/xMTH1hp/In-response-to-multiple-complaints-we-received-under-the-US-Digital-Millennium.png">
				copyright message</a> at the bottom of the search page, check the "Complaint" links
				and search for your title/try out some of the URLs.</p>

			<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
			<p><ul>
				<li>If a website <span class="italics">forces</span> you to disable your ad blocker, move on.
				This is different than them asking you nicely to turn it off.</li>
				<li>Ad blockers are not always 100% effective! Never open anything you didn’t download knowingly.
					Also, sometimes popup ads will show up <span class="italics">under</span> your window,
					so make sure you close out of those.</li>
				<li>Never follow a site's directive to create an account, download their VPN, or install an extension. Move on.</li>
				<li>Most media—unless it's very new or very obscure—will have an HD source somewhere, so keep looking if you're not satisfied.</li>
				<li>Sometimes, even if you have good WiFi, certain video players just won’t load/buffer fast enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
					You can try choosing a different player source from the same website, which is usually accessible via a
					dropdown menu or some buttons above/below the video player.</li>
